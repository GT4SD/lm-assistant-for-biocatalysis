## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **PyMOL**: Molecular visualization system. [Install PyMOL via Conda](https://pymol.org/2/#download)
- **GROMACS**: Molecular dynamics package. [Install GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/install-guide/index.html)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com/GT4SD/lm-assistant-for-biocatalysis
   cd lm-assistant-for-biocatalysis
   ```

2. **Install Poetry and Project Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Setup Molecular Dynamics Files, RXNAAMapper, Enzyme Optimization Models, and BLAST Databases**

    The setup script now supports a new `--blastdb` option to control which BLAST database(s) to download:
    
    - **Default Behavior:** If no `--blastdb` option is provided, only the Swissprot database is downloaded.
    - **Custom Database:** Pass a specific BLAST database name (e.g., `nr`) to download that database.
    - **All Databases:** Pass `all` to download a predefined set of BLAST databases (swissprot, nr, nt, refseq_protein, refseq_rna, pdb).
    
    Choose one of the following options based on your operating system:
    
    a) For macOS users with Homebrew:
    
    ```bash
    bash tools_setup/setup.sh --blastdb <db_name|all>
    ```
    
    b) For users on other operating systems or without Homebrew (skip Minio Client installation):
    
    ```bash
    bash tools_setup/setup.sh --skip-mc --blastdb <db_name|all>
    ```

    The script performs the following actions:

    - **RXNAAMapper Setup**
         - Sets up the BERT model, tokenizer, and vocabulary.
    - **Minio Client (mc) Setup** (unless skipped via `--skip-mc`)
         - Installs Minio Client using Homebrew.
         - Configures Minio Client with predefined credentials.
    - **Enzyme Optimization Models Setup**
         - Downloads and sets up models for enzyme optimization (requires Minio).
    - **BLAST+ Installation and Database Setup**
         - Installs BLAST+ if not already installed.
         - Downloads the specified BLAST database(s) based on the `--blastdb` option.

    **Note:** If you're not using macOS or don't have Homebrew, use the `--skip-mc` option and manually install Minio Client for your operating system.

4. **Install Additional Required Tools**

   - **PyMOL**
   - **GROMACS**

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your configuration:

   ```env
   KEY=your_key_here
   API=your_api_here
   ```

   > **Note**: Ensure that `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to protect sensitive information.

## Configuration

Each tool within the Biocatalysis Assistant has its own configuration options that can be customized using environment variables. Refer to the [Tool Documentation](./docs/tools.md) for specific configuration details.

## Usage

### Running the Biocatalysis Assistant

The Biocatalysis Assistant offers two interfaces for interaction: a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Streamlit web application. Choose the interface that best suits your needs.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

To start the Biocatalysis Assistant using the CLI:

1. Ensure you have completed the installation process using Poetry.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
lmabc --help
```

This displays a help message similar to:

```
Biocatalysis Assistant CLI Help

DESCRIPTION:
    This CLI provides an interface to interact with the Biocatalysis Assistant,
    allowing users to ask questions and receive responses related to biocatalysis.

USAGE:
    lmabc

INITIAL SETUP:
    Upon starting, you will be prompted to:
    1. Set verbosity level
    2. Confirm or change the model and provider

COMMANDS:
    help   : Display this help message
    exit   : Exit the program
    clear  : Clear the screen

INTERACTION:
    After setup, you can start asking questions. The assistant will process your
    input and provide responses based on its knowledge of biocatalysis.

EXAMPLES:
    - To ask a question:
      > Enter your question: What are the main types of enzyme catalysis?

    - To clear the screen:
      > Enter your question: clear

    - To exit the program:
      > Enter your question: exit
```

#### Streamlit Web Application

To run the Biocatalysis Assistant using the Streamlit web interface:

1. Ensure you have completed the installation process using Poetry.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
lmabc-app
```

This starts the Streamlit server and automatically opens the web application in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, the terminal will display a local URL you can copy and paste into your browser.

The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface with:
- A chat-like interaction on the home page.
- A list of available tools.
- Settings for customizing the assistant's configuration.
